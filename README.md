Protein-peptide docking dataset used in the following article:

This is an extension of the PeptiDB benchmark published by London N. et al. 
DOI: [10.1016/j.str.2009.11.012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20159464)

The dataset contains:
- 98 protein-peptide bound complexes (list in bound-complexes.list)
- 59 receptor unbound forms (list in unbound-complexes.list)
- 98 peptide unbound forms

The restraints to guide the docking are based on:
- protein binding site as active (defined with a 5A cutoff)
- peptide defined as fully passive
